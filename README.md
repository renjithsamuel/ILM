# Library Management System

The Library Management System is a web application designed to streamline library operations, enhance user engagement, and automate various tasks. It caters to two main user types: patrons and librarians. Built with Next.js, TypeScript, Golang, and PostgreSQL, this application focuses on providing a seamless experience for managing book collections, wishlists, reservations, and checkouts.
